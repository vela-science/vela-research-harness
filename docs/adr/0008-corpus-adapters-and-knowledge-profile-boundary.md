# ADR 0008: Corpus adapters and the knowledge-profile boundary

- Status: Proposed
- Release posture: Unscheduled; no Canopus version is reserved
- Protocol effect: None
- Entry gate: both conditions below must pass before implementation
  1. two stable, licensed, machine-readable workbench export formats require
     the same demonstrably reusable fields; and
  2. the parent ecosystem's in-place Erdős reader experiment records a GO
     result without moving authority out of Vela.

## Context

The Vela product story is intentionally short:

```text
produce → preserve → check → decide → reuse
```

Canopus owns **Produce** only. A canonical frontier Git repository preserves
the work. Vela checks replay and verifier evidence. Signed policy or a protected
human decision decides scientific standing. The read-only Observatory and
other replaceable readers support reuse.

Research tools such as Codex, Entire, OpenScience, OpenResearch, notebooks, and
batch schedulers can expose useful execution records. That does not by itself
justify a shared Canopus schema, adapter SDK, profile revision, CLI family, or
semantic service. Each abstraction would become permanent product surface and
could blur Canopus's narrow role.

The evidence currently supports studying source formats, not shipping a new
interoperability layer. One source-specific path is not a platform boundary.

## Proposed decision

Do not implement a shared adapter system yet.

1. Start with a small source-local export/import script for each independently
   useful format.
2. Keep every script offline, content-addressed, authority-free, and removable.
3. Record the exact licensed source schema, version, exported bytes, missing
   fields, and any duplicated mapping logic.
4. Reopen this ADR only after two real formats require the same core and the
   parent Erdős reader experiment has passed its own authority and loss checks.
5. If the gates pass, promote only the fields and code proved common by those
   two implementations. Delete the source-local duplication in the same
   change.

The following remain candidate ideas, not approved interfaces:

- `canopus.research-activity.v1`;
- `canopus.profile.v3` and a knowledge binding;
- a shared adapter registry or SDK;
- `canopus adapter ...` and `canopus activity ...` commands; and
- any new semantic repository, daemon, database, or hosted service.

Mission v1, profile v1/v2, run records, withdrawal capabilities, and all
released evidence remain unchanged.

## Why this boundary is simpler

| Candidate | Product step | Existing capability reused | Duplication it must delete | Exit condition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Source-local import script | Produce | Source tool export, Canopus canonical JSON and custody checks | One manual or bespoke conversion for that source | Remove if the source format is unstable, unlicensed, network-dependent, or unused |
| Shared activity envelope | Produce-to-preserve handoff | Mission v1 and run v1 fields, full SHA-256 roots | The same mapping code in two maintained source adapters | Reject if fewer than two formats need it or source-specific fields leak into the core |
| Profile v3 binding | Produce | Closed profile v2 and Vela Receipt evidence | Repeated semantic-root binding in two real profiles | Do not implement until two real profiles require the same closed binding |
| Adapter SDK/registry | Produce | Existing native custody scanner and source-boundary validation | Duplicate hostile-input and canonicalization logic in two maintained adapters | Delete or keep source-local if the shared layer is larger than the code removed |
| Adapter/activity CLI | Produce | Existing `doctor`, `run`, `inspect`, and `replay` command patterns | Repeated operator invocation that survives two real uses | Do not add until a stable shared contract exists |

There is no candidate authority step in this table. Imported activity is
research memory unless it enters Vela through the existing Receipt, proposal,
policy, and decision path.

## Source-format evidence gate

A source counts toward the two-format gate only when it has:

1. a stable versioned machine-readable export;
2. a license permitting implementation and fixture distribution;
3. exact retained source bytes and a full content root;
4. deterministic offline parsing from an explicit file or directory;
5. completed, failed, cancelled, partial, and unknown-field fixtures where the
   source format can express them; and
6. a real use that removes a bespoke handoff or enables a reproducible one.

Current candidates:

- Entire CLI `v0.8.42` checkpoint exports may qualify after a disposable,
  prehydrated, network-denied export proves complete capture without mutating
  the canonical source.
- OpenScience may qualify only after its exact version, Apache-2.0 source,
  stable export, and redistributable fixtures are pinned.
- OpenResearch is precedent only while its public export format or license is
  absent or unstable.
- Cursor Origin is precedent only while it lacks a stable public schema,
  implementation surface, and license.

Direct Codex transcript parsing is not a second independent format. Add it only
if a retained fixture proves a released workbench export omits evidence needed
for an existing Canopus mission.

## Candidate contract constraints

If the entry gate passes, any shared activity record must remain a closed,
authority-free observation. At minimum it would bind:

- producer and adapter identity and full artifact roots;
- objective, declared bounds, process outcome, and explicit missing fields;
- exact repository commit/tree or deterministic dirty-worktree manifest;
- input packet, profile, capsule, artifact, and verifier roots when present;
- resource use, interventions, caveats, capture coverage, and source-export
  root; and
- `authority_effect: none`.

It must not contain chain of thought, scientific standing, an accepted flag, a
mutable `latest` identity, or an inferred claim. Branch names, provider session
IDs, timestamps, run numbers, and short IDs remain locator metadata only.

Unknown source fields, if retention is necessary, belong in one rooted opaque
attachment. Missing, unknown, redacted, and not-applicable values remain
distinct. Redaction produces a declared derivative and never claims byte
identity with the source.

## Safety and replay requirements

Every source-local experiment and any future shared layer must fail closed on:

- changed source bytes, adapter substitution, short roots, or mutable source
  identity;
- path traversal, symlink escape, device files, oversized archives, or archive
  bombs;
- environment variables, tokens, cookies, key directories, private paths, or
  unrelated host files entering output;
- network-dependent conversion or replay;
- dirty worktrees without a deterministic rooted manifest;
- workbench success presented as verifier success or scientific standing;
- a verifier observation without exact subject and verifier roots; or
- any mutation of a canonical frontier.

Re-importing identical source bytes with the same script or future adapter
version must be byte-identical. Changed source bytes create a new record and
never overwrite the first. Permissive inspection may report a rooted opaque
source and diagnostics, but it cannot land a Receipt or supply policy context.

## Evidence required to reopen this ADR

Reconsider implementation only when all of the following are recorded:

1. the parent Erdős reader experiment is GO;
2. two qualifying licensed formats have working source-local scripts;
3. their independently written mappings expose a concrete common core;
4. promoting that core removes more maintained code than it adds;
5. exact replay works offline from retained bytes;
6. hostile custody fixtures show no secret or human-key exposure; and
7. Vela state changes only through the released Receipt/proposal/policy path.

Passing these gates authorizes a new decision, not an automatic release. The
ADR must then name the smallest exact interface and a release target based on
the implementation actually selected.

## Alternatives rejected for now

- **Reserve a Canopus release and build the abstraction speculatively.** This
  turns a research question into permanent product surface before the shared
  need exists.
- **Make Canopus a general research workbench.** Existing tools already own
  execution UX; duplicating them adds bloat and custody risk.
- **Put workbench adapters in Vela.** Source formats are not protocol or
  authority semantics.
- **Ingest directly into Neon.** The read model is disposable and cannot be the
  only retained or replayable record.
- **Create a `vela-knowledge` service first.** The reader experiment must prove
  a missing boundary before a repository, package, or service can be justified.
- **Accept free-form JSON.** Unknown semantics, secrets, and authority language
  would cross the boundary silently.

## Consequences

Canopus stays small and understandable. Useful source-specific experiments can
proceed without reserving a release or creating a framework. A shared contract
will exist only if two real integrations and the Erdős reader experiment prove
that it deletes duplication while preserving the Vela authority boundary.
