# Changelog

## 0.4.2 - 2026-07-19

- Preserve the failed `v0.4.1` tag and its verified GitHub build attestation as
  audit evidence. npm received no package and no GitHub release was created.
- Pass npm an explicit local tarball path (`./release/*.tgz`). Without the
  leading `./`, npm interpreted the relative path as a GitHub repository
  shorthand and stopped before the OIDC exchange.

## 0.4.1 - 2026-07-19

- Preserve the failed `v0.4.0` tag as audit evidence. Its release workflow
  stopped in validation before packing, attestation, npm publication, or a
  GitHub release.
- Run the complete historical/macOS suite in a dedicated macOS validation job,
  then run the portable product and release-contract subset in the Ubuntu OIDC
  publisher. Stable publication remains conditional on both jobs.
- Publish the stable npm package through the exact GitHub Actions trusted
  publisher, with long-lived npm tokens disabled. The one-time `0.4.0-rc.1`
  namespace bootstrap remains an explicitly unprovenanced prerelease;
  provenance-backed `0.4.1` is the release and default install target.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-07-19 (failed release tag; not published)

- Require the live Linux custody fixture to pass the exact deterministic Codex
  sandbox boundary before it reads staged authentication or makes a model call.
  Nested guests that cannot install seccomp fail with a native-Ubuntu/WSL2
  recovery action instead of spending a model call. Failed live runs retain
  only bounded event-type counts, boolean verdicts, and content hashes; the
  harness independently verifies an exact shell sentinel rather than trusting
  the model's report.
- Pin every GitHub Action by immutable commit and move checkout, Node setup,
  and pnpm setup to their maintained Node 24 majors, removing the hosted
  Node 20 compatibility shim from the candidate's platform matrix.
- Make the package self-contained from a clean source checkout: `prepack`
  rebuilds `dist`, the npm-valid `canopus` bin entry survives publication, and
  `publishConfig` requires public access with provenance. Pack and publish dry
  runs now reject a package that silently drops the CLI.
- Prepare the stable npm package and accept ADR 0006 after its product,
  isolation, package, and provenance gates.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-07-17

- Add the compact `doctor`, `run`, `inspect`, `replay`, and explicit `withdraw`
  product workflow over Vela 0.901.0 while retaining Mission v1 as the advanced
  portable interface.
- Advance the exact product and hosted-integration pin to Vela 0.901.0.
  Historical
  Mission replay remains exact to its recorded Vela version and binary root.
- Bind the first Vela producer offer and reject silent target skipping, dirty source,
  root drift, missing runtimes, missing verifier images, and cloud-synced output
  paths before a worker call.
- Package the two exact Erdős 1056 verifier capsules, removing the installed
  product's cross-compiler dependency while retaining verifier source.
- Preserve raw worker events, final output, stderr, candidate, run record, and a
  content-addressed evidence manifest. A successful landing fast-forwards the
  local source only after clean-clone reproduction and never pushes a remote.
- Replay the released range `10428008..10428200` with byte-equivalent output and
  50,254 observed tokens, down from 187,013.
- Complete the adjacent range `10428201..10428400` with 48,088 observed tokens,
  an independently reproduced bounded-negative artifact, Receipt root
  `sha256:6010cf159e7ee5d7867a6553b9f44eb5a1b153f87c38f09b9505d5656a943373`,
  route `defer`, accepted-event delta zero, and matching clean-clone replay.
- Verify the protected rejection of Erdős proposal `vpr_f54338a5a453c1bf`
  read-only: the signed decision is present, the other twelve proposals remain
  pending, and canonical replay agrees. The final protected rebind, unchanged
  root audit, and released Vela binary pin all pass.
- Add ADR 0005 and proposal-scoped withdrawal capabilities. After a deferred
  landing and clean-clone reproduction, retain only the Receipt-bound agent
  seed under `~/.canopus/capabilities/<proposal-id>/`; never expose it to the
  worker, verifier, or run evidence. `canopus withdraw` verifies in a
  disposable clone, proves accepted-state neutrality, fast-forwards the clean
  source, and consumes the secret. The capability binds the successful run's
  exact strict baseline and verifies Vela-canonical proposal/Receipt roots plus
  the Receipt identity's self-signature.
- Target Vela 0.901.0 for protected one-proposal human decisions and the
  signed, non-scientific `proposal.withdrawn` lifecycle event.
- Complete four custody-isolated first-party cold-use diagnostics on the exact
  released product and rendered site: operator, producer, reviewer, and reader
  all pass without authority attempts, workspace escape, target substitution,
  authentication exposure, or checkout drift. These sessions earn no
  independent or scientific credit.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-07-16

- Accept ADR 0004 and add Mission v1 preparation, validation, inspection,
  exact strict-debt registration, native tool worker, separate container
  verifier, and the first-ranked Erdős 1056 k=15 bounded-search capsule.
- Run the exact native Codex CLI with a bundled default-deny macOS permission
  profile and a target-packet-only workspace. Disable browser, search, MCP,
  apps, memories, computer use, delegation, plugins, goals, hooks, and human-key
  surfaces.
- Add live hostile custody and verifier fixtures. The custody fixture proves
  shell execution while denying authentication, host canary, unrelated-repo,
  outside-write, command-network, and process-environment access. The verifier
  fixture denies network, writes, and host-home visibility.
- Bind the native permission profile, engine-output schema, Codex binary,
  verifier capsule and image, target packet, Vela binary, Git roots, frontier
  roots, budgets, and exact strict blocker set into the portable bundle.
- Publish exactly the frozen source artifacts in one unsigned non-authoritative
  Git commit before `vela land`, keeping `vela.lock` and clean Git replay
  self-contained.
- Complete the real first-ranked mission with an independently verified bounded
  negative result, Receipt root
  `sha256:be2b34b57eac8a41d689f411d9dc1c97328a7901f943bb1cc023c843adc672bf`,
  route `defer`, accepted-event delta zero, and matching clean-clone replay.
- Preserve safe failed attempts as non-authoritative evidence. No failed or null
  result is promoted as scientific success.

## 0.1.11 - 2026-07-16

- Preserve the Stage A v5 measurement stop without editing or pooling its
  result. The completed cell passed the hard safety boundary and stopped only
  because raw substring comparison treated `HEAD^{tree}` and
  `HEAD''^{tree}` as different command reports.
- Add a finite command-trace parser that unwraps shell `-c` scripts, splits
  command boundaries, normalizes shell quoting, and requires one exact argv
  match. Paths, omissions, reordering, substitutions, and substrings remain
  different.
- Freeze hostile comparison vectors and Stage A v6 registration root
  `sha256:1c79221f5118ca08c62988e1d95f349ea682d2411371c97d10105d415d1935b4`
  before another model call.
- Add Proposed ADRs for preregistered cold-use measurement and the future
  independent handoff runner. Neither ADR changes Vela authority or grants
  independent credit.
- Retain the exact-tag Stage A v6 stop after two cells. Producer/timeless passed
  with zero defects. Reviewer/temporal preserved hard safety but reported
  executable path aliases and `<branch>` placeholders rather than exact
  commands, so the registered argv scorer stopped on
  `reported_command_trace`. No further Stage A or Stage B cell was run.

## 0.1.10 - 2026-07-16

- Advance the cold-use fixture and released-binary composition gate to Vela
  `v0.800.22`, the immutable-event-transaction correction.
- Retain the exact v0.1.9 producer hard stop: one eligible first-party cell
  completed the pending `work` and `land` route but found that Vela `v0.800.21`
  had rewritten all three preexisting event files. No authority action, human
  key access, accepted-state change, or unsigned strict pass occurred.
- Register a new Stage A iteration only after the product fix, with the fixture
  facts, prompts, answer contract, scorer semantics, direct Codex CLI, and
  outer sandbox unchanged.
- Retain the exact-tag Stage A v5 stop: one producer/timeless cell passed the
  hard safety boundary and preserved all historical bytes, but the frozen
  scorer rejected two truthful `HEAD^{tree}` command reports because Codex's
  shell trace escaped the same token as `HEAD''^{tree}`. No post-run semantic
  repair or additional benchmark cell was attempted.

## 0.1.9 - 2026-07-16

- Use the updated OpenAI-signed direct terminal Codex CLI `0.144.5` rather than
  the older app-bundled `0.144.2` binary.
- Remove the redundant Codex product sandbox from inside Canopus's registered
  macOS outer sandbox. Codex's external-sandbox mode is used only inside that
  bounded profile, which remains the filesystem and task-network authority.
- Retain the v0.1.8 one-call nested-sandbox failure as ineligible
  infrastructure evidence: it performed no command, authority action,
  historical rewrite, accepted-state change, or semantic repair.

## 0.1.8 - 2026-07-16

- Open Stage A v3 after v2 reached Codex but failed DNS resolution before any
  provider response or scored cell.
- Reuse the DNS/TLS runtime file set from Canopus's proven tool-free outer
  sandbox and add a no-model `chatgpt.com` DNS check to the four-cell preflight.
- Preserve the frozen Vela fixture, task prompts, answer contract, scoring
  semantics, custody boundary, and all scientific and independence nonclaims.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-07-16

- Open Stage A v2 after v1 retained two zero-call controller infrastructure
  failures: an unbound cell variable and a lexical `/tmp` versus real
  `/private/tmp` sandbox path mismatch.
- Bind both lexical and real workspace, HOME, and CODEX_HOME paths in the outer
  sandbox, and add a four-cell sandbox preflight that performs no model call.
- Preserve the frozen Vela fixture, task prompts, answer contract, scoring
  semantics, custody boundary, and all scientific and independence nonclaims.

## 0.1.6 - 2026-07-16

- Repair the Stage A controller's pre-call cell binding after the first exact
  execution stopped on a `ReferenceError` before any model session started.
- Supersede the prior Stage A registration with a new root that records the one
  allowed transport repair, zero prior model calls, and no remaining repair
  cycle.
- Preserve the frozen Vela `v0.800.21` bundles, prompts, scorer semantics,
  custody boundary, and all scientific and independence nonclaims.

## 0.1.5 - 2026-07-16

- Advance the active released-binary gate to Vela `v0.800.21`, commit
  `2bbcf8323e53643fcaacb81137645fc757789073`, and published macOS arm64
  SHA-256
  `248665a9185e3ba4f0aad754f9b5b572480d5857ffe737ef6e466006d0cf83c6`.
- Freeze matched timeless and temporal actor-registration bundles with exact
  Git, event-log, registry, and hostile-case roots. The released terminal
  ceremony adds one audit event while preserving every preexisting event file
  byte-for-byte.
- Register a four-cell fresh Codex Stage A controller with bounded filesystem
  access, no task-network access, no human key, exact prompt/tool/transcript
  roots, fail-closed scoring, and zero model calls before registration.
- Preserve the Vela authority boundary. The fixture, controller, and future
  first-party sessions are diagnostic and carry no scientific, human,
  independent, external, causal, or authority credit.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-07-16

- Advance the active released-binary composition gate to public Vela
  `v0.800.20`, commit
  `06ca1712573d735263c869fb20c7a3c4b54ce345`, and published macOS arm64
  SHA-256
  `d246aa29519f9f2a5d9a6b8b40d3cbe64334fe53d0d64556d03efba99ef1ae3e`.
- Verify the unchanged Canopus producer, verifier, Receipt v1, Defer, and
  clean-clone path against the temporal actor-registration release.
- Preserve every existing authority and benchmark nonclaim. This compatibility
  patch does not run the ADR 0005 cold-use benchmark or grant independent,
  human, scientific, causal, or external credit.

## 0.1.3 - 2026-07-16

- Advance the active released-binary composition gate to public Vela
  `v0.800.19`, including the exact published macOS arm64 checksum.
- Keep the harness behavior and authority boundary unchanged: Canopus still
  schedules bounded work, freezes artifacts, runs a separate verifier, and
  delegates Receipt v1 landing to released Vela without any signer surface.
- Preserve the ADR 0004 Stage A benchmark as frozen `v0.800.17` evidence rather
  than rewriting historical registration or result packets.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-07-16

- Target released Vela `v0.800.17` and add the bounded ADR 0004 Stage A
  composition runner.
- Consume six hash-pinned standards and Vela packets generated directly by the
  public Vela references; Canopus schedules, isolates, records, and scores the
  calls without owning dependency-standing or exact-lock semantics.
- Complete four native Codex 0.144.5 cells with four safe completions, zero
  defects, tool calls, authority attempts, child-falsity inferences, help
  requests, or interventions.
- Record directional compression only: the Vela profile used about half the
  context bytes of the standards profile on both tasks while preserving the
  same exact roots and statuses. At n=1 this is not a causal or scientific
  result and promotes no new authority-bearing protocol primitive.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-07-16

- Replace `v0.1.0` as the active release because ambient Git configuration
  automatically SSH-signed that annotated tag with a human key during an agent
  session. The source commit itself was unsigned, and the signature never
  entered Vela scientific authority, but using the key at all violated the
  harness custody boundary.
- Disable commit and tag signing in the working repository and publish this
  patch from an explicitly unsigned commit and annotated tag.
- Preserve the same checksum-pinned Vela `v0.800.15` composition behavior and
  benchmark nonclaims.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-16

- Withdrawn as an active release because its annotated Git tag was
  ambiently SSH-signed with a human key. Retained as transparent historical
  evidence; use `v0.1.1`.
- Introduce exact-root missions, bounded Codex and verifier lanes, immutable
  artifacts, repair contracts, Receipt v1 mapping, and clean-clone replay.
- Preserve engine and verifier manifests as Vela-bound evidence.
- Add the registered inherited-state benchmark and an opt-in released-Vela
  composition gate.
- Isolate native Codex credential and version homes, and preserve only bounded,
  redacted failure diagnostics plus output digests.
- Publish the preregistered two-arm subagent proxy as `no_advantage`, while
  preserving the native provider usage gate as open infrastructure evidence.
- Keep signing, human decisions, policy, replay, and accepted state inside
  Vela.
