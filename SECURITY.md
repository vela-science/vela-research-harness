# Security

Report vulnerabilities privately through GitHub Security Advisories for
`vela-science/vela-research-harness`.

Canopus does not accept human signing keys. Do not place a human Vela key,
provider credential, or unpublished scientific secret inside a run root.
Successful runs scrub the isolated agent-key home, but operators remain
responsible for deleting failed diagnostic runs and benchmark output.

Agent-authored Git commits and tags must explicitly disable ambient signing
(`commit.gpgSign=false`, `tag.gpgSign=false`) and verify that the resulting Git
objects contain no signature. A repository-local configuration now disables
both for this working copy. The withdrawn `v0.1.0` tag and some earlier
pre-release implementation commits retain unintended human SSH signatures from
ambient Git configuration as transparent historical evidence. Those
signatures are not Vela authority, but agents must never create another one.

The v0 isolation backend is macOS Seatbelt. Other platforms fail closed; they
do not receive a permissive fallback.

Mission v1 uses the exact native Codex CLI with a bundled default-deny macOS
permission profile. Only the target packet is writable and command-readable.
The runtime authentication copy, sealed source checkout, Vela home, host home,
host canary, and unrelated repositories must remain outside that boundary.
Every run performs a deterministic custody preflight; the live hostile fixture
also proves shell execution while denying credential reads, command network,
outside writes, and auth-bearing process environment.

The verifier is a separate pinned container with no network and no writable
persistent mount. Canopus never places the producer, verifier, or model in the
Vela signing path.
