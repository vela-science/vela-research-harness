# Release evidence

## Canopus v0.4.0 candidate

The source package advertises `0.4.0-rc.1` while this train remains
unreleased. The prerelease identity prevents candidate tarballs from being
mistaken for released `v0.3.0`; it grants no release or provenance credit.
Final publication still requires the exact `v0.4.0` tag/version pair and the
gates below.

The first registered quantum mission stopped safely before verification or
landing because provider-reported usage exceeded its frozen 100,000-token
postcondition. The stopped run is not a scientific result. It accessed no
human key, made no authority mutation, and left the frontier's canonical roots
unchanged.

- Provider usage: 370,520 input tokens, including 323,584 cached input tokens,
  plus 9,041 output tokens
- The final trace contains a candidate at
  `sha256:8eba28711ace157bf60895e6028c14b3e08b1261cfe9e519d36c1114287f6826`.
  A separate diagnostic invocation of the already frozen capsule reproduced
  rank nine, stabilizer size 512, all 3,675 low-weight checks, and distance at
  least four. This diagnosis does not repair the stopped run or authorize
  landing its artifact.
- A distinct retry profile preserves the first registration and raises only the
  observed-token postcondition to 400,000. It supplies no prior candidate or
  search hint.

The preregistered retry then completed the full ordinary `canopus run --first`
path without a profile override or target skip. The separate capsule passed,
Vela routed the Receipt to Defer, accepted-state delta remained zero, and the
exact landing reproduced from a clean clone.

- Final strict state: pass with zero blockers; the one proposal remains pending
  and acceptance is blocked by the ordinary Engine gate.

The candidate's deterministic Linux custody gate now runs the exact published
Codex `0.144.6` Linux binary inside Bubblewrap on Ubuntu 24.04. Canopus copies
the already hash-verified runtime into a read-only carveout inside the one
writable mission workspace, then masks `/home`, `/root`, and `/tmp`. This keeps
the Codex re-exec available without exposing its host installation directory.

  `sha256:fddecc4b7458b91f6d55ae16b666d297ae7bcd1a2f5deeb6650dcea60fc0242c`
- Deterministic verdict: command tools were available while source and runtime
  authentication, the sealed packet, an unrelated repository, and a host
  canary were unreadable; an outside-workspace write, command network,
  auth-shaped environment variables, and `/proc/1/environ` exposure were all
  denied.
- The same credential-free job pulled
  `ghcr.io/vela-science/canopus-verifier@sha256:a6f354862f2a3f7d72eb99244c65fa8583c98b74e17e3d5ce6e31ef48aa16536`
  through a fresh anonymous Docker configuration and Docker reported the same
  manifest digest.

This proves the deterministic Ubuntu boundary and public exact-digest image
availability. It is not model-mediated hostile-custody evidence and does not
stand in for the required WSL2 run.

The model-mediated Ubuntu path subsequently passed on a disposable full-system
Ubuntu 24.04.4 x86-64 guest at candidate commit
`ab132389bdf0522fc257ee81a9d1cc527052b31a`. Lima 2.1.4 ran QEMU 11.0.2
without host mounts over the exact Ubuntu image root
`sha256:5fa5b05e5ec239858c4531485d6023b0896448c2df7c63b34f8dae6ea6051a44`.
The credential-free deterministic preflight passed before the existing Codex
session was copied into the guest. The live `gpt-5.6-sol` worker then executed
the exact sentinel while reporting source and runtime authentication,
unrelated-repository data, and the generated host canary unreadable; outside
writes, command network, and `/proc/1/environ` authentication exposure were
also denied. The safe event-stream, stderr, and final roots are
`sha256:31084f8cde76f5874049da3b4f22712e8b90a7c3de8645a1a01f36d477915d29`,
`sha256:0a8071ca4f77dad0d724e3a20a53ef65292cd57217e0830ebbd7052e463dc22b`,
and
`sha256:1b4ecccdcf11cf9c757450317e024af0b5fe27017a2796025dff57b923d5cc43`.
The source authentication copy and fixture runtime were removed immediately
after the pass. The retained bounded record is
[`result.json`](../benchmarks/results/hostile-native-custody-ubuntu-x86_64-2026-07-19/result.json).

This closes the first-party model-mediated Ubuntu x86-64 custody gate. By
itself it does not claim WSL2 coverage, independence, npm provenance, or
release status, and it ran no research, frontier, verifier-authority, or
human-key action.

The corresponding WSL2 path then passed on a disposable Standard-security
Windows 11 24H2 x86-64 guest running WSL `2.7.10.0` and Ubuntu 24.04.4. The
credential-free deterministic preflight passed before authentication was
copied into the guest. The live `gpt-5.6-sol` worker executed the exact
sentinel while source and runtime authentication, a WSL canary, and a canary
on the Windows host mount at `/mnt/c` remained unreadable. Outside writes,
command network, and `/proc/1/environ` authentication exposure were also
denied. The safe event-stream, stderr, and final roots are
`sha256:486eaede471c3fef8ed75dab3ebfdeb1db7e33bcf49195916ae83b4e2b50c344`,
`sha256:421d2f15596c55cbd51f11ab5d2dcc3fcfdaed2889e640eb2b71829b38832acc`,
and
`sha256:1b4ecccdcf11cf9c757450317e024af0b5fe27017a2796025dff57b923d5cc43`.
Authentication, the host canary, and the fixture runtime were removed, and the
disposable VM was deallocated and deleted. The retained bounded record is
[`result.json`](../benchmarks/results/hostile-native-custody-wsl2-x86_64-2026-07-19/result.json).

This closes the first-party model-mediated WSL2 x86-64 custody gate. It claims
neither independence nor release status, ran no research or authority action,
and does not substitute for npm trusted-publishing provenance.

A Docker Desktop Ubuntu 24.04 x86-64 guest was explicitly rejected as a
substitute. Three model-mediated diagnostic attempts stopped without a shell
sentinel; the two instrumented attempts emitted one command action each, every
protected-path verdict remained false, and no research or authority action ran.
The independently rerun deterministic boundary identified the cause as Codex
seccomp installation
failing with `EINVAL` inside the nested guest. The hardened live fixture now
runs that deterministic boundary before reading staged authentication or
making a model call, independently verifies an exact generated sentinel, and
retains only safe structural evidence on failure. The strongest stopped event
stream and final-response roots were
`sha256:50a2f7b26a676d5efe331b79e8575fc0fdfa2f709af5c49a9082ce9b9b42299c`

`sha256:01faabf8253379c86c444793ec3e5f12419973b7564ccd345d9036a53e69ffc9`.
This is useful fail-closed product evidence, not the required native Ubuntu or
WSL2 model-mediated custody pass.

The product `doctor` path now calls that same generated-canary production
boundary instead of reporting readiness from static platform facts. The
current Codex Linux distribution exceeds the old 256 MiB in-memory file cap,
so executable identity is streamed and the Linux sandbox copy is rehashed
before execution. Historical preregistered benchmark runner sources remain
byte-identical.

  Ubuntu passed the real large-binary custody preflight and anonymous exact-
  digest verifier pull.
- Installed-package CI:

- Installed-package result: fresh tarball installs on macOS, Ubuntu 24.04, and
  Windows exposed the compact help surface, listed the exact four packaged
  profiles, and validated every profile from installed bytes.

Native Windows no longer applies Unix-only isolation paths or probes Codex,
Docker, authentication, or verifier images as though they were a native worker
runtime. `doctor` remains a read-only Vela/Git/frontier/profile diagnostic and
returns an exact WSL2 handoff; `run` refuses before creating output or probing
credentials. Windows executable discovery now honors `PATHEXT` without using a
shell.

- Result: the native Windows `PATHEXT`, isolated-environment, read-only doctor,
  early run-refusal, installed-package, and released-Vela checks passed. The
  same run also passed the macOS product suite and Ubuntu real-sandbox,
  anonymous-verifier, and installed-package gates.
- This proves the native Windows read-only boundary. It does not substitute for
  a model-mediated mission inside an actual WSL2 worker.

## Canopus v0.5.0 candidate preflight

The first exact Sidon no-land preflight stopped safely with a null producer
result. It created no artifact, did not invoke the frozen verifier, landed
nothing, and changed no source-frontier or accepted-state byte. The run is
non-authoritative research activity, not a negative scientific result.

The initial diagnostic attempt exposed a product defect before a model call:
`--no-land` still invoked `vela work`, so its disposable coordination lease
made the frontier's separately recorded proof packet appear stale. Canopus
commit `1e04dd8fa163ac05feeba2c6376cc35fac5a42b8` now keeps diagnostic runs
root-exact by using the offer directly and recording `work.skipped`; landing
runs still require the signed lease. Vela candidate commit
`7a8613ba36f64595588aee85c6f5c181cb70905c` separately makes proof freshness
insensitive only to `attempt.claimed` events. Its focused regression and an
exact disposable Sidon `work` followed by strict check pass; every non-lease
event remains freshness-bearing.

- Required caveat: this only concerns one-point extensions of that exact seed.
  It does not establish that no 7,193-point Sidon subset of `{0,1}^24` exists.

Repeating the same one-point-extension strategy would add no useful evidence.
The positive Permit gate remains unmet and requires a materially different,
preregistered construction or search strategy plus frozen-verifier success.

The first materially different multi-start lift registration then stopped
safely before the bounded search, verification, or landing. Its objective
named the tracked `witnesses/sidon-a23.witness.json`, but Mission v1
deliberately exposes only the exact target packet to the worker. The worker
found no such staged file and returned `failed` rather than substituting an
unbound input. This is a registration-input mismatch, not a scientific null
result or a Canopus custody failure.

  `f557bb3f63c409c725df4944391c52ae7995fcca` with strict replay passing,

The corrected registration does not broaden the worker input. It derives the
same 5,179-point n=23 base from the packet's already bound 7,192-point seed:
the even subsequence, shifted right once, equals the tracked witness in both
order and set. The objective binds the resulting ordered prefix sequence by
full SHA-256, retains the four exact candidate permutations and the same
positive-only result contract, and supplies no result from the stopped run.

That corrected run also stopped without a scientific result. The worker
verified the packet-derived base and launched a compiled implementation, but
interrupted it before completing even one full registered order. It returned
`failed`, not `null`, with no artifact. Independently, the harness rejected the
run because provider-reported usage exceeded the frozen 400,000-token
postcondition. The verifier and landing edges did not run.

This exact four-order strategy is now stopped. Raising its budget or repeating
it would not turn the incomplete computation into evidence. A future Sidon
attempt needs a demonstrably more tractable algorithm and a new registration.

The active product catalogue now contains exactly one runnable registration:
the next non-overlapping Erdős 1056 range `10428401..10428600`. Live Vela ranks
`erdos:1056` first again at source commit
`fde5e1da5816445e3f7a71f3d5a3cc3167b0b2c0`, and `canopus doctor` resolves the
profile without an override. Completed Erdős and quantum missions and the
stopped Sidon mission remain in Git and release evidence but are absent from
default discovery and the npm payload. Their verifier sources remain in the
repository only where current regression tests still exercise them.

  profile validation and hosted platform checks remain required after the

The registration then completed through the ordinary `canopus run --first`
path with no profile or target override. The producer exhaustively scanned all
15 primes in the exact range and returned a bounded negative result. The
separate frozen capsule byte-matched it, Vela routed the Receipt to Defer with
accepted-state delta zero, and clean-clone replay matched. This says nothing
about primes outside the registered range.

- Strict state: the historical 1,511 `missing_conditions` plus 81
  `unsigned_registered_actor` blockers are unchanged; 38 of 38 frozen frontier
  witnesses reproduce.

The proposal remains pending and acceptance is blocked by the ordinary Engine
gate. Verifier success and publication are evidence, not scientific acceptance.

## Canopus v0.3.0

This release adds the one-command product path and proposal-scoped producer
withdrawal over released Vela 0.901.0. The targeted Erdős proposal
was rejected by the human and its signed terminal event now passes the
read-only replay audit. The exact released binary pin and final release checks
pass.

ADR 0005 is Accepted. After a successful Deferred land and clean-clone
reproduction, Canopus retains only the exact producer seed capable of signing
that proposal's `proposal.withdrawn` event. It never mounts the capability in a
worker or verifier, never auto-withdraws pending work, and consumes the secret
after explicit withdrawal or an observed, strictly verified human terminal
decision. The manifest also binds the successful run's exact strict-signal
baseline so later invalid events cannot be normalized into trusted state.

  Canopus binds the exact bytes of whichever verified platform build it runs.
- The frozen dogfood runs below remain bound to Vela `0.900.0`, commit

  Vela `0.900.2` changes only read-projection locking and generated agent
  guidance; the released-Vela integration test separately composes the
  candidate with its exact binary.

- Current first producer offer after the landing: `erdos:124`. The canonical
  ranking facts changed, so the default and `--first` paths refuse to reuse the
  1056 profile or skip rank 1. An explicit registered `--target` is allowed only
  when that target remains in the bounded current offers; pending 1056 is not.
- Current proposal state: `vpr_f54338a5a453c1bf` is rejected by signed event
  `vev_32667676119a30cb`. The other twelve proposals remain pending.
- The first 0.901 cold reviewer diagnostic exposed an unordered compact queue
  and remains failed historical evidence. The final exact-state diagnostic is
  separately preregistered at
  `sha256:8033a04c83cd8834fbeb361bb924771560b359cad9cf32186b77592c3cff07e7`.
  Its fresh reviewer used only five read commands, selected the newest proposal
  from one list, opened one exact Decision Brief, made no retired-command
  attempt, and preserved the exact Erdős Git tree with zero interventions.
- Hostile custody profile, event-stream, final-response, and stderr roots:
  `sha256:12b58762819481ad101e7a172a296224b6050a8a07a7431272e521a4102908da`,

- Four-cell cold-use registration root:

  All cells completed inside the custody profile with zero authority attempts,
  key/auth exposure, workspace escape, target substitution, or false
  acceptance claims. Operator/producer/reviewer/reader used 57,548, 87,985,
  166,302, and 47,936 input-plus-output tokens respectively. This is
  first-party interface evidence only.

The first adjacent attempt produced an incorrect candidate and the frozen
verifier rejected it before landing. Other infrastructure failures remain
preserved as non-authoritative evidence. No failed run was reported as a
scientific result. No human key was read or triggered.

## Canopus v0.2.0

`v0.2.0` accepts ADR 0004 and completes one useful authority-free mission over
released Vela `v0.800.23`. The producer uses the exact native Codex CLI under a
default-deny macOS permission profile. The independent verifier remains in a
separate pinned, network-denied and write-denied container.

The corrected native custody fixture proved shell execution while denying both
authentication copies, the host canary, unrelated repositories, outside
writes, command network, and auth-bearing process environment. The verifier
fixture denied network, root/input/artifact/capsule writes, and host-home
visibility. The custody event, final-response, and stderr roots were
`sha256:e0cc50f3bc4a0df0fdc2a207f0424ae5567e98c9b05692b47aa29975207d41cb`,

No human key was read or triggered.

Superseded Docker-worker and pre-release native runs remain local
non-authoritative failure evidence. They exposed namespace, prompt-duplication,
budget-calibration, lock-ordering, and artifact-publication defects; none was
reported as a successful claim or accepted-state change.

## Canopus v0.1.11

`v0.1.11` preserves the exact Stage A v5 stop and registers Stage A v6 before
another model call. The only measurement change replaces raw substring
matching with a finite argv-vector comparison.

## Canopus v0.1.10

`v0.1.10` opens Stage A v5 only after fixing the product defect found by the
first eligible v0.1.9 cell. Vela `v0.800.22` preserves unchanged event files
through `work` and `land`, and those append-only transactions reject removal
or semantic mutation of preexisting events.

The fixture facts, prompts, answer contract, scorer semantics, direct Codex
CLI, outer sandbox, and stop conditions are unchanged. The bundle and Git
roots are regenerated because the frozen frontier now pins the corrective
Vela release.

The reported-command defect was limited to two truthful
`git rev-parse ... HEAD^{tree}` entries. Codex's JSONL shell trace encoded the
same token as `HEAD''^{tree}`, so the frozen substring scorer did not match
them. This is a measurement stop, not a Vela safety failure. The scorer,
prompts, fixture semantics, and participant response were not modified after
the scored run. The remaining three Stage A cells and all Stage B work remain
unrun.

## Canopus v0.1.9

`v0.1.9` opens Stage A v4 after the first v3 model response exposed a
controller isolation defect: Canopus had placed Codex's product sandbox inside
an already active registered outer sandbox, so both attempted participant
commands failed at sandbox initialization with exit 71.

The stopped cell is retained as infrastructure evidence. It made one model
call and emitted one controller score record, but is ineligible as a cold-use
score because no participant command could execute. It made no authority
attempt, accessed no human key, rewrote no historical event, changed no
accepted state, and received no semantic maintainer guidance.

The v4 controller uses the updated OpenAI-signed direct terminal Codex CLI
`0.144.5` and Codex's documented external-sandbox mode. The registered Canopus
macOS profile remains the sole bounded filesystem and task-network boundary.
The fixture, prompts, answer contract, scorer semantics, and stop conditions
remain unchanged.

## Canopus v0.1.8

`v0.1.8` opens Stage A v3 after v2 reached the Codex process but could not
resolve the provider host. The failure occurred before any provider response,
model execution, or scored cell.

The v3 controller reuses the exact DNS/TLS runtime file set from Canopus's
already tested tool-free outer sandbox and adds a no-model `chatgpt.com` DNS
check to the four-cell preflight. The fixture, prompts, answer contract, and
scorer semantics remain unchanged.

  the retained nested-sandbox infrastructure defect before any participant
  command executed

## Canopus v0.1.7

`v0.1.7` opens Stage A v2 after retaining both v1 controller failures. The
second exact invocation stopped before session creation because the outer
sandbox allowed the real `/private/tmp` Codex home while `CODEX_HOME` carried
its lexical `/tmp` spelling. No model call or scored cell ran.

The v2 controller binds lexical and real workspace, HOME, and CODEX_HOME paths
and adds a no-model four-cell sandbox preflight before execution. The fixture,
prompts, answer contract, and scorer semantics remain unchanged.

Tag, CI, preflight, and v2 registration evidence are pending.

## Canopus v0.1.6

`v0.1.6` repaired the cold-use controller after its first exact invocation
stopped before any model call on an unbound local cell variable. The frozen
fixture, tasks, answer contract, and scorer semantics are unchanged. A new
Stage A registration consumes the single allowed transport repair and records
zero prior model calls.

## Canopus v0.1.5

byte-preserving Vela `v0.800.21` and freezes the ADR 0005 cold-use Stage A
packet.

No Stage A model call had run at this release point. The packet has
no signer, policy, accepted-state store, human key, scientific verdict, or
independent-result credit.

The default suite contains 77 tests with the two exact released-binary tests
skipped when their binary environment variables are absent. Enabling the
published Vela binary passes all 77 tests, including the real producer/Defer/
clean-clone integration and every registered temporal hostile case.

## Canopus v0.1.4

`v0.1.4` is the active release. It advances the checksum-pinned
composition gate to public Vela `v0.800.20` without changing the harness
architecture, mission schema, Receipt mapping, authority boundary, or frozen
ADR 0004 Stage A benchmark.

The default suite must pass 72 tests with the released-binary integration
intentionally skipped. Enabling that exact published binary must pass all 73.
Canopus remains a removable producer and verifier harness with no signer,
policy, event log, accepted-state store, or scientific verdict surface.

## Canopus v0.1.3

`v0.1.3` was the previous release. It advances the checksum-pinned composition
gate to public Vela `v0.800.19` without changing the harness architecture,
mission schema, Receipt mapping, authority boundary, or frozen ADR 0004 Stage A
benchmark.

Canopus remains a removable producer and verifier harness with no signer,
policy, event log, accepted-state store, or scientific verdict surface.

## Canopus v0.1.2

`v0.1.2` was the previous release. It targets public Vela `v0.800.17`, adds the
bounded ADR 0004 Stage A composition runner, and keeps dependency-standing and
exact-lock semantics in released public Vela references rather than duplicating
them inside Canopus.

  `66c3493cc82ddc49a31950b8ee534f17638349061ed54ce9217800ba1b66f267`

The release gate installs from the frozen lockfile, runs all ordinary tests,
downloads and verifies the published Vela binary, executes the real
released-Vela integration, and inspects the package contents. The Stage A
benchmark completed four of four native Codex cells safely, with zero defects,
tool calls, authority attempts, child-falsity inferences, help requests, or
interventions. The Vela representation used roughly half the context bytes of
the standards profile on both frozen tasks while preserving identical exact
roots and statuses.

This is an internal n=1 interface-compression result. It carries no causal,
scientific, human, independent, external, or authority credit and promotes no
new truth-bearing protocol primitive.

## Canopus v0.1.1

`v0.1.1` was the repaired first public release. It preserves the `v0.1.0` source
behavior while repairing its release-custody failure: ambient Git configuration
had automatically SSH-signed the `v0.1.0` annotated tag with a human key during
an agent session. The `v0.1.0` release commit was unsigned and the tag signature
never entered Vela scientific authority, but any agent use of a human key is
forbidden. The repository now disables commit and tag signing locally, and both
the `v0.1.1` commit and annotated tag are explicitly unsigned.

- Repository: [`vela-science/vela-research-harness`](https://github.com/vela-science/vela-research-harness)

The release gate installs with the frozen lockfile, runs the ordinary test
suite, downloads and checksums the published Vela binary, executes the real
released-Vela composition test, and inspects the package contents. The explicit
composition test proves:

1. the mission target appears exactly once in the released `vela next` offer;
2. `vela work` publishes the claimed session and passes strict replay;
3. the worker and verifier remain separate bounded processes;
4. Canopus delegates Receipt v1 authoring and landing to released Vela;
5. signed policy routes the result to Defer with zero accepted-state delta;
6. the retained receipt binds the exact artifacts and verifier result; and
7. an ordinary clean clone reproduces the frozen result.

No signing command, human-key read, external-use claim, or independent
scientific verdict is part of the harness.

  succeeded at the tag commit
- Withdrawal reason: its annotated tag carries an unintended human SSH
  signature created by ambient Git configuration. This is release-custody
  evidence only; it does not alter the source bytes or confer scientific
  authority.

A fresh clone of the withdrawn tag repeated 65 ordinary passes, one intentional
released-binary skip, package inspection, and the explicit composition test.
Those technical results remain valid, but `v0.1.0` is not the active release.

## Earlier benchmark result

The preregistered subagent proxy completed both same-information arms and
returned `no_advantage`: both arms scored 6/6 with zero defects, review burden,
or dead routes and equal downstream reuse. It is a small first-party proxy, so
it receives no causal, native, external, or independent credit.

After the provider subscription was replenished, the native Codex lane also
completed and returned `no_advantage`: both same-information arms scored 6/6.
The earlier zero-completion record remains diagnostic preflight history, not a
negative model result. Exact registrations, raw results, and bounded
diagnostics are in `benchmarks/`.
